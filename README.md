---   PHOTOGRAPHY WEBSITE (Updated 1/9/24)   ---

---   OVERVIEW   ---
This repository contains the source code for the photography website put together by Grant Mayer and Gavin Gallagher. This website is currently hosted at the following link: https://grantmayer123423.000webhostapp.com/

--- PURPOSE   ---
The purpose of this project was to create a series of web documents that would satisfy the requirements for our CEET 353 class, however, we choose to go beyond those expextations. The purposed function was to create a website that would host photography from Gavin Gallagher. The site would host photo albums with unique photos in each. Upon clicking on any photo within an album, the photo would be added to a digital cart. When the user views the cart, they have the ability to either remove items or proceed to checkout. If the user checks out, a form is submitted to Gavin via email where the transaction can be completed via CashApp/Venmo. 

---   Languages   ---
This project was written with HTML, PHP, CSS, and JavaScript. 

---   Additional Notes   ---
While the images are stored in the source code, this was done because the current state of the class had not yet reached full utilization of database managment. Instead, we developed a dynamic system that allowed automatic generation of album code if photos are uploaded in a certain format. In order for this to work, photos would have to be entered into the site in a folder called "albums_"... Where you can put any name of an album after the underscore. For example, if one uploades a folder called "albums_My First Album", then a album will automatically be generated in the website called "My First Album" with all the accompanying photos.
